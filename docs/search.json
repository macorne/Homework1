    "text": "What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nData scientists and statisticians both need a keen understanding of the data with which they are working. Both must also be able to present their findings coherently and cohesively.\nHowever, data scientists and statisticians differ in several ways. First, data scientists use statistical techniques to obtain results, while statisticians develop statistical techniques and specific statistics. It is not that data scientists cannot do these things, but they are more often occupied with data cleaning, data manipulation, responding to the needs of customers, and coordinating with integration teams to make sure their models work or work in concert with other models.\nSecond, statisticians tend to be involved in frame management and development of survey questions. Again, data scientists may be involved in these activities, but they often lack training to execute these tasks accurately. Data scientists work with the data after it has already been generated. They are less involved than statisticians in the generation of raw data."

    "text": "How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nMy job title is “mathematical statistician.” My work actually does not involve very much statistics - at most, we use basic linear regression - and in fact it doesn’t involve any complicated mathematics. My own background is in mathematics and physics, so I would say that I have more in common with statisticians except that I have never developed a survey, done statistically rigorous experimental design, or worked in frame management. By now, my experiences with data and data manipulation probably align moreso with those of a data scientist.\n##Iris Petal Width Code Chunk\nDetermine the class, type, and structure of the object y:\n\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\nUse the plot function on the object y:"
